# grandMA3_lua_functions
A Visual Sudio Code Library of grandMA3 in-built functions

A library of grandMA3 specific Lua functions, formatted for use with Visual Studio Code alongside the LuaLS language server.
Place the "grandMA3_lua_functions.lua" file in your Visual Studio Code workspace, in a directory named "definitions".

This is simply a reformatting of the grandMA3_lua_functions.txt file that is generated in the grandMA3 application by executing "LuaHelp" in the command line.
